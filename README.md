# Dumbchess

A chess game with a twist.

## Rules

1. Black squares are assigned randomly
2. You cannot go over black squares using Rook, Queen and Bishop, but you can step on them and move over on the next turn
3. You can set your pieces wherever you like on your two rows
4. Win gives you 500 points, loss gives you 250 points
5. You can buy pieces in the shop
6. If you have two kings, you need to lose both of them to lose the match
